## Why did I build this? ðŸ¤”

Keen to expand my programming skills, I decided to learn Swift, a key language for iOS development.  Many weather apps were quite complex, and I saw an opportunity to simplify.  

Thus, I created BarWeather as a project at Fanshawe College. Learning Swift while also striving for user-friendly design, I leveraged the REST Weather API and Firebase for reliable forecasts. Despite challenges, the development of BarWeather emphasized the power of continuous learning and creative problem-solving.
